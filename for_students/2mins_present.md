# Two Minute Papers

In the spirit of [this YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz/videos), we will be starting each class with a brief student presentation of a recent research paper. Everyone is expected to present once; **this is a large part of your class participation grade**.

Sign up for a presentation slot by filling out an online Excel. Empty slots in the schedule will be filled by a student selected uniformly at random from the set of students who have not yet presented.

## Format

A two minute oral presentation, accompanied by visual aid. Slides are nice, but not required: you may show figures directly from the paper, or any existing video that supplements the paper.
